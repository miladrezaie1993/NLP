1. Classifying Document
   
      In this project, the goal is to build a model that can automatically categorize news articles into different topics or classes, enabling the search engine to deliver relevant content to           users efficiently. To achieve this, we will leverage the powerful torchtext library, which simplifies the process of creating a dataset for text classification analysis.
      
      With torchtext, we'll have the flexibility to access and preprocess raw news data effortlessly. The library enables us to convert text strings into torch.Tensors, which are essential for          training machine learning models. By using torchtext's convenient functionalities, we can set up an efficient data processing pipeline that prepares the text data for classification.
